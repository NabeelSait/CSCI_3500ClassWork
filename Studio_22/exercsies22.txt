4. It should catch every instance of a 1 bit flip

5. If two 1's are flipped to 0, or two 0s are flipped to 1's, the parity bit will not help
catch this error

6. The parity bit catches an error when it changes the number of 1s from even to odd or vice versa
(so addition by an odd number). It fails to catch changes otherwise.
