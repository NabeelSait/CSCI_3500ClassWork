2. There was a bug sometime in development where two EOF would be necessary to exit. This bug 
was not replicated since and we are thus unsure if it remains in the final build.
In addition, sometimes commands like sort ( ps aux do not execute in time, unless, for some reason, 
one is in gdb. This issue does not seem to exist at the moment, but it did on an earlier, mostly
identical build.
The code is set up to catch null commands, however, incorrect syntax normally just causes the command
to execute as intended, as if the syntax was correct. 

3. The extra credit assignment was completed.
