4. The hardware address is: 0c:c4:7a:54:51:da

5. hopper.slu.edu

6. The command returns the IP address or addresses of the website

7. It is possible that slu.edu uses multiple servers, thus requiring multiple
IP addresses

Layer 1: The IrDA is a set of protocols for infrared communication, which would naturally
be in the physical layer
Layer 2: The Adress Resolution protocol is a communication protocol used to determine the link layer address 
associated with a given internet layer address. Since this is a form of data linking, it makes sense that it 
is in the data link layer
Layer 3: Network Address Translation is a method for remapping one IP address space into another. Since this is
a network operation (working with IP address) it makes sense to be in the Network Layer
Layer 4: AppleTalk Echo Protocol is a transport layer protocol designed to test the reachability of network nodes.
Since this deals with communication between networks, it makes sense that it is in the transport layer
Layer 5: Passowrd Authentication Protocol is a method for authenticating users based on passwords. Since this 
is required for many sessions to take place, and can't be done before communication is established
, it makes sense to be in the Session Layer. 
Layer 6: Transfer Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secruity over a network. Since this deals
with secure communication after authentication, this makes sense to be in this layer
Layer 7: Hypettext Transfer Protocol (or HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, colloborative, hypermedia information systems.
In short, it makes hyperlinks and websites work. Since this takes place in the application part of a website (something with
direct user interaction), it makes sense to be in the application layer.
