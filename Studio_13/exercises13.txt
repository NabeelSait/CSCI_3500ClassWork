5. It doesn’t matter if a number is prime or not that doesn’t affect the next number
6. If a number is divisible by five, there is no need to continue checking if it is prime. So,
it would reduce the work required if the numbers were checked sequentially
7. Yes

9. We would create a number of threads with the same quantity as the testings. We would use a structure with an integer that would send it to the void function that would check if said number is parallel or not.
