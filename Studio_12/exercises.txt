2. The function signature is type __sync_add_and_fetch (type *ptr, type value), and the function
is to add value to the object pointed to by ptr. It returns the new value.

The average real time for the program is 0.838 s

6. The average real time for Studio 11's program is (based on redone measurements) is
.183 s. 

7. The mutex locking strategy is roughly 4.6 times faster than atomic instructions

8. The average real time for Studio 10's racy program is .235 s, based on new measurements

So, the atomic instructions are about 1.28 times faster

9. Mutex locking is likely prefereable for speed. However, if you have more threads
that need to be run simlutaneously, atomic instructions may be better
