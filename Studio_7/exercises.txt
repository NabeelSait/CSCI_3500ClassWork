1. Nabeel Sait and Cemil Can Ali Marandi

Program 1:
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

   char buffer[] = "Hello, world!\n";
   write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, 14);

   return 0;
}

Program 2:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
   int size = 50;
   char buffer[size];

   while(1)
   {
      char *check = fgets(buffer, size, stdin);
      if (check == NULL)
         break;
      printf("Program 2 got: %s\n", buffer);
   }
}

2. 
Hello, world!

3. fd[0] contains the read end, and fd[1] contains the write end

4. newfd is closed if the program succeeds

5. 
 dup2(pfd[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
 dup2(pfd[0], STDIN_FILENO);

6. Program 2 got: Hello, world!

7.Program 2 got: Hello, world!

8. One benefit is that a program can be written for general use with a particular filestream
and then easily used with any filestream, depending on the needs of the user. Another is that programs
can be written into pipelines to use the results of other programs in place of their filestreams.
