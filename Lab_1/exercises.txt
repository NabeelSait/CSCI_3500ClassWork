2. The compression technique works well when a file has many repeating patterns, and works poorly otherwise.
It likely works better in a binary context than with plaintext. 

3. The ones with bias will likely compress better, so strong_bias should compress the best.

1mil_random: .625 (yes, this file got larger)

1mil_weak_bias: 1.17

1mil_strong_bias: 2.44

4. The program takes 29.936s to run in real time

5. The program takes 26.936s to run in real time. The read and strncmp operations take place less frequently,
but with more data for each operation. This is what likely accounts for the slightly lower runtime. 

6. Both extra credit problems were attempted

EC1. The decompressed logo is indeed undistorted. The compression ratio for the photo is 36.97 
with rle. It has a ratio of 16.66 with a PNG conversion, and 41.27 with a JPEG conversion.

EC2. The compression ratio with rle is 0.517. The compression ratio for the JPEG is 19.85,
and the PNG has a ratio of 2.023. There are no discernible visual differences between the 
pictures.
